Tech Stack:
	->Rest assured library for service layer automation
	->Java for programming language
	->Maven for project building
	->Testng for test execution
	->extent reports for reporting 
	
Reports were stored in the reports folder.
test execution id kick started from api tests
base test contains all the initialization part
end points were maintained in a seperate space
request body is published in seperate json file

Enhancements:
Given the time i wanted to implement serialization and de serialization in order to extract the response and add more assertions
And also i wanted to implement schema verification as well
And also wanted to work on attaching the request and responses as a part of the report itself
